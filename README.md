Two Projects made for UQ's CSSE2002 Semester 1 2023.

DISCLAIMER: Not all code provided was implemented by me, some was provided by UQ

Project 1:
Modelling Space Journeys of the Leaden Matter

This is a terminal text-based space adventure with full functionality that allows for travel between different planets, spending of resources, upgrading of the ship, etc.

Project 2:
Production Factory Belt System

This is a GUI based simulation of a belt system at a factory during production. Data is input in text files and read into the code by custom made methods that are translated and represented in an animation in a GUI interface
